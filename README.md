Three VHDL projects made for digital logic course.

Project 1 is a simple 4-way XOR chip with a testbench to demonstrate accuracy.

Project 2 takes the implementation from project 1 and uses a self-checking testbench for all 16 possible inputs for the 4-bit chip.

Project 3 is a more complex project that handles multiple inputs and outputs to simulate a traffic light controller, all within an encoded chip.
